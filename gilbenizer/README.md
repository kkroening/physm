This was a science experiment from ~Jan 2018 to try to retrain Tacotron with Gilbert Gottfried's voice by taking an audiobook narrated by Gilbert and generating transcribed sample data.  I didn't actually get Tacotron to work with the sample data, but the transcription process worked fairly well by automating use of Google Speech API.
