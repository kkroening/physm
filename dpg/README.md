# dpg: depthmap polygon generator

This was a science experiment from a while back (~Jan 2018) for rendering depthmaps from blender and automatically inferring 3d polygon structure.

It has a few potentially useful things:
- Run Blender headlessly and/or with pytest
- Expose quirkiness of Blender's depthmap output, which seems to have some nonlinearities
- Various notebooks for doing image analysis
